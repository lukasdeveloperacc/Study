## Predicted Interview Questions

### Technical
1. **Go Fundamentals & Concurrency:**  
   - Explain goroutines vs threads; safe concurrency patterns using channels and `context.Context`.  
   - How do you handle timeouts, cancellations, and error propagation in Go services?  
2. **Microservices & API Design:**  
   - Compare REST vs gRPC; design a versioned payments API.  
   - How would you structure service boundaries for transaction processing and reconciliation?  
3. **Cloud & DevOps:**  
   - Walk through deploying a Go service to AWS ECS/EKS.  
   - Describe infrastructure-as-code approach (Terraform vs CloudFormation).  
4. **Security & Compliance:**  
   - What steps ensure PCI DSS compliance in a microservice?  
   - How do you enforce encryption in transit and at rest?  
5. **System Design:**  
   - Design a high-throughput, idempotent payment pipeline.  
   - Strategies for retry, dead-letter queues, and consistency.  
6. **CI/CD & Observability:**  
   - Outline a CI/CD pipeline for Go services with automated tests and blue/green deploys.  
   - How do you instrument and monitor service health (SLIs/SLAs)?  

### Behavioral
- Describe a time you led an architecture discussion under tight deadlines.  
- How do you mentor junior engineers and share knowledge?  
- Tell me about a production incident you managed—what went wrong and how you resolved it?

## Concepts To Know/Review
- Go syntax, idioms, error handling, `context.Context`  
- Concurrency primitives: goroutines, channels, mutexes  
- gRPC service definition, streaming, code generation  
- Microservices architecture patterns (circuit breakers, service mesh basics)  
- AWS core services: ECS/EKS, IAM, VPC networking, S3, RDS  
- Dockerfile best practices, Kubernetes resources (Deployments, Services, Ingress)  
- PCI DSS high-level requirements, encryption, secure coding  
- System design: high-availability, idempotency, retry logic, data consistency  
- CI/CD tooling: GitHub Actions, Terraform/CloudFormation

## Strategic Advice
**Tone & Focus:**  
- Be confident about your cloud and microservices expertise; frame your Go learning as proactive and hands-on.  
- Emphasize reliability, security, and operational maturity in past projects.  
- Use data points (latency improvements, deployment time reductions) to quantify impact.

**Key Themes to Highlight:**  
- Cross-functional collaboration: share examples of working with Product, Security, QA.  
- Ownership of end-to-end delivery: from design through monitoring in production.  
- Mentorship and communication: how you elevate team standards.

**Red Flags to Watch:**  
- Vague answers on compliance or security—prepare PCI DSS talking points.  
- Underestimating the Go learning curve—demonstrate concrete practice (small side projects).  
- Lack of questions on team processes or career progression—show curiosity.

**Final Tips:**  
- Prepare a short code snippet or diagram when discussing concurrency or system design.  
- If asked about gaps (e.g., “only 3 years experience”), pivot to depth of impact and speed of growth.  
- Close by reiterating excitement for FinGear’s mission to empower developers in payments.

Good luck—go build something great!
